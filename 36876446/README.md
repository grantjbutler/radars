## Summary:
When using Xcode's built in documentation comment generator (Editor>Structure>Add Documentation), if you are trying to add documentation to a failable Swift initializer, Xcode will fail to generate the comment with the error "Nothing found to document at the current location." If the initializer is made to not be failable, then Xcode can generate the comment.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a Swift class/enum/struct with a failable initializer.
2. Add a documentation comment using the "Add Documentation" menu item (or its equivalent keyboard shortcut)

## Expected Results:
The appropriate documentation comment stub is generated by Xcode and inserted into my source code.

## Actual Results:
Xcode shows the error "Nothing found to document at the current location"

## Version/Build:
Xcode 9.2 (9C40b)
macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G1114)
